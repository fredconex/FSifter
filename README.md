# FileSifter

This project provides a file 'sifting' utility, allowing users to selectively filter their files and folders. By using this tool, users can automatically create a new directory structure, populating it with their chosen files and folders from a given source. It offers a streamlined way to declutter and manage digital content. 

  **Usage:**
  [executale_name] [options] \
  **Options:** \
  -build "path"   - Build at the specified path. \
  -src "path"  - Edit from the specified path. \
  **Example:**
    FileSifter.exe -build "C:\target\path"

The edit is done with a gui, build is done by command line.
